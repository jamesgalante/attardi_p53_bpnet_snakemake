# This is the corresponding ENCODE download link for the file that's in $OAK/akundaje/zhangby/mouse-atlas/reference/mm10.chrom.sizes
# Notably, in the ENCODE reference genome files, there's another file called mm10.chrom.sizes named the same as that in boyang's dir
# However, when comparing the contents of these files, boyang's version comes from the linked file 'no_alt'

# This is the corresponding ENCODE download link for the file that's in $OAK/zhangby/mouse-atlas/reference/mm10_no_alt_analysis_set_ENCODE.fasta
# I confirmed these files are the exact same with sha256sum, which produced the same hash

# The mm10 blacklist was found via a reference to the blacklist repo in the bpnet repo. i.e. In https://github.com/kundajelab/bpnet/wiki/Download-test-data
# Linked is: https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/ which contains https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/master/lists/Blacklist_v1/mm10-blacklist.bed.gz
# In boyang's folder this exact file is then slopped with bedtools by 1057 on both sides. Both the original nonslopped slopped files were confirmed the same with sha256sum
# Where $CHROM_SIZES refers to the above link, and mm10-blacklist.bed is the link provided, the following command run on sherlock produces the blacklist file used in other p53 atac pancreas processing
# ml load biology; ml load bedtools; bedtools slop -i mm10-blacklist.bed -g $CHROM_SIZES -b 1057 > mm10-blacklist.slop1057.bed

# HOCOMOCO v14 CORE
# In v14, this single file is used for both Human and Mouse (see FAQ).
# Note: Motif names will use Human nomenclature (e.g., SOX2).
